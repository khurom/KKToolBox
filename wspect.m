% WSPECT estimates the spectral power density of a time
% series using the discrete wavelet decomposition. The power
% density is estimated at scales that are distributed on a dyadic grid
%   y       time series [array]
%   dt      sampling period, default is 1
%   wname   wavelet name, in Matlab syntax. Default is 'db4' for 4th
%           order Daubechies
%   displ   Display results if displ>0. Default is with display
%   p       power density : [n,1] array
%   scale   corresponding scale axis : [n,1] array
%   dp      standard deviation of P estimated from variability

% notes: Need to get rid of edge effects -- This will make this routine
% perfect.
% Also note the effect from choices of wavelet bases with few zero moments.
% Notice that the Haar Wavelet overestimates the PSD especially when the
% steeper slope is encountered. This is because the Haar has only one zero
% moment. This means it can only detect PSD slopes of -3 or higher. To
% detect a power-law slope of f^-{\beta} one requires a wavelet with
% M>(\beta - 1)/2
